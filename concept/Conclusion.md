# 8. Conclusion
As you already read in this document, it is currently a highly abstract concept.

We are happy for any feedback on that concept, as it is not yet implemented.

We will convert that concept into a documentation of the actual implementation,
as soon as we have a working prototype.

## 8.1. What is missing?
Currently, there are many parts that aren't 100% clear yet, but this concept has nighter the goal to be 100% clear,
nor tries it.
