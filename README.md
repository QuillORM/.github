# .github
The .github repository is used for the README on organisation level.

In addition, this repository will also hold the
[concept](https://github.com/QuillORM/.github/blob/main/concept/Concept.md) of QuillORM during the
early stage of conception.

As the project matures, the concept will be removed and replaced with a documentation,
which will be hosted in its own repository.
